# IETF Hackathon
Repository for sharing code, presentations, and other artifacts at IETF hackathons.
Note that from IETF 95 onward, https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/hackathon/meetings/ is the location used to share hackathon presentations, and code is shared using project specific repositories that may exist within the IETF-Hackathon github organization or elsewhere.

## Overview
IETF Hackathons encourage developers to collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards.


## Technologies
IETF Hackathons cover a range of topics associated with existing IETF standards, research groups, working groups, internet drafts, and related open source projects. Examples of topcis from previous hackathions include BIER (Bit Index Explicit Replication), HTTP/2.0, NETCONF/YANG, NETVC (Network Video Codec), OpenDaylight, RIOT, SFC, and SPUD (Substrate Protocol Underneath Datagrams). New technologies are always encouraged!


## Goals
* Advance pace and relevance of IETF standards activities by bringing the speed and collaborative spirit of open source development into the IETF (e.g. targeted standards areas where ideas are flushed out, sample code is produced, and useful utilities are developed)
* Bring developers and young people into IETF and get them exposed to and interested in IETF
